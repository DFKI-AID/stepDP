## Work Packages
- Slots, interfaces, candidates, Hypothesen
- Resolution: einzelne Methoden zB f√ºr Persondeixis (interfaces)
- DialogComponent basierend auf state chart (SC als parameter)
- Task Model generiert bsp state chart?
- IMP
- Knowledge Base
- Dialog Coordination: meta attributes for dialog functions




## Concepts
### KnowledgeBase
- using persistance collections to provide a map and list based implementation for storing entities
    - sync not necessary for reading
    - entities won't change once a component request them
- Ontology: 
    - Entity class 
      - supports arbitrary attributes
      - persistent data structure / immutable (if the type of all used attribute is persistent)
        - components can return Entities without thinking about concurrency
        - easier to track changes like Add, Delete, Update (check)
    - Schemes ensure that necessary properties are set
      - each function / component has different requirements can thus define different schemes
    - If multiple components write attributes of the same entity, they should use the **update** function. This avoids that changes of other components are overwritten
- TODO: serialization for external access



## Install

### Development
- Install Python, Java 1.8
- Clone this repo
- Run install.py (in intranet) to install all dependencies

### Usage
- Follow the steps of devlopment and add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>de.dfki.tocalog</groupId>
            <artifactId>core</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.2</version>
        </dependency>
```


## Future Work / Ideas
- using MDP to model the dialog
    - wrong actions / timeouts / help request can trigger the system to provide information about the current task
    - based on the task, a planning system generates the MDP as way how the humans can solve the task while also incoporating points of failure
